# Optimizer – Intelligent System Optimization for Device Longevity

A Flutter-based application that improves device efficiency, performance, and longevity through intelligent, software-level optimization.

---

## 📱 Project Overview

**Optimizer** is a smart device efficiency manager built using Flutter.  
The app focuses on **predictive and preventive optimization** instead of reacting after problems like battery drain, overheating, or performance drops occur.

The project demonstrates how **usage-based analysis and intelligent control logic** can help improve overall device health and user experience.

## ✨ Features Implemented

### 🔋 Battery Power Saving
- Simulates battery level monitoring
- Automatically activates power-saving mode when battery is low
- Displays real-time battery percentage and optimization status

### ⏳ Idle App Detection
- Identifies apps that have not been used for long periods (simulated)
- Highlights idle apps that may consume background resources
- Suggests limiting background activity

### 🧹 Cache Cleanup
- Displays cache-heavy apps (simulated data)
- Allows clearing cache through a simulated cleanup process
- Helps improve storage efficiency and performance

### 🌡️ Thermal-Aware Performance Controller
- Predicts thermal risk using usage patterns
- Prevents overheating instead of reacting late
- Reduces background load before performance degradation occurs

## 🧠 Core Innovation

> **Preventive optimization instead of reactive system behavior**

The app focuses on predicting inefficiencies early and taking intelligent actions through software-level logic.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Flutter
- **Language:** Dart
- **UI:** Material Design (Dark Theme)
- **Data Source:** Simulated system data (for hackathon demonstration)

## ⚠️ Note

Due to mobile OS security restrictions:
- Hardware-level controls (battery, CPU temperature, background processes) are simulated
- The project focuses on logic, UI, and optimization concepts
- Can be extended using native platform channels in future versions

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Integration with real battery and thermal sensors
- Native Android integration using platform channels
- AI-based prediction of battery drain and overheating
- Expansion to tablets and other smart devices
